# Event Type Processing Script

NOTE: this tool is only for internal NR employees

## Overview

This Python script queries the New Relic NerdGraph API to retrieve unique event namespaces based on specified event types. It checks whether each namespace is billable by referencing a local configuration file (`namespaces.txt`). The results are then saved to a CSV file (`event_type_results.csv`).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library (install via pip if not already installed)
- API Key of NR Admin who is a Full Platform user that has access to query data in account 313870

## Steps

1. Clone this repository
2. Edit 'API-Key': 'REDACTED' in the script to utilize your NR internal API key agaisnt account 313870
2. Ensure you have the following files in the same directory as the script:
* event_types.csv: A CSV file containing the event types you want to query.
* namespaces.txt: A text file containing namespace configurations with billable statuses -- note this txt file is taken from [here](https://source.datanerd.us/core-data-platform/namespaces/blob/b0cca6d7d4f34afca370524538254ef89e14779a/src/main/resources/namespaces.yml) which is only accessible to NR employees.
3. Run the script
4. After execution, check event_type_results.csv for the output, which will contain:
* Event Type
* Namespace
* Billable (True/False)
